TODO
- Reactivate "options" menu - Need to:
-- make audio manager to toggle sound effects on and off, and 
-- provide option to pay to remove ads.
- Chop and add extra grunt noises (Just Steph now)
- Fix up game over menu (include exact table flip count?) - Deanna

BUGS

- Fix in game gui/game manager calls, as they are FUCKING AWFUL right now.
-- Use delegates and callbacks with CloseBlinker()
--- Fix this in every place I'm persistently checking for bool statuses - IDIOT
