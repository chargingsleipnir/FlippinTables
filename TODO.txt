TODO
- Deanna to do facial expression for flip.
- Get "options" and "extras" menus happening. (Optional)
-- Other extras (purpose for combo counter) ("Good", "Excellent" flip system, might not be worth the trouble)
- Audio (maybe replace flip sounds)
- Ads.
- Mobile device customization (icons - steph)

BUGS

- Retry button stays in it's "clicked" colour (Done??)
- Figure out those button-related warnings if possible...
- Fix in game gui/game manager calls, as they are FUCKING AWFUL right now.
