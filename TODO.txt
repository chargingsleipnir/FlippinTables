- Deanna to do facial expression for flip.

-- provide option to pay to remove ads.
- Ads.
- Mobile device customization (icons - steph)
- Make the background jitter on impact
- Chop and add extra grunt noises

BUGS

- Figure out those button-related warnings if possible...
- Fix in game gui/game manager calls, as they are FUCKING AWFUL right now.
-- Use delegates and callbacks with CloseBlinker()
--- Fix this in every place I'm persistently checking for bool statuses - IDIOT
