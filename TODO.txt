TODO
- Put slower moving skyscraper art in BG
- Put 50% alpha black/grey screen in front of game when gameover menu comes up.
- Speed up transitions
- Include transition on retry?
- Bring in Steph's newly shaded art.
- Deanna to do more facial expressions and art pieces.
- Get "options" and "extras" menus happening.
- Include some other fleeing office workers? (Could take a bit of work...)
-- Other extras (purpose for combo counter)
- Ads.

BUGS

- Some gui elements (transitions) not resizing with screen.
- Retry button stays in it's "clicked" colour
- Gameover menu text not accurate after 1st try.
- Figure out those button-related warnings if possible...
